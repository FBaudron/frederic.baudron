The project ‘Détection précoce et Réponse rapide : Maladie du balai de sorcière du Manioc’ (DECODE) is gathering urgently needed data on the distribution and impact of the Cassava Witches’ Broom disease (CWBD), an emerging disease in French Guiana as well as Brazil, and evaluating the risk for other high value crops (e.g., cocoa); This project will provide the basis for a coordinated response by the Direction Générale de l'Alimentation, in conjunction with operators, researchers, farmers and local authorities, to implement effective containment, management and control strategies in French Guiana.
