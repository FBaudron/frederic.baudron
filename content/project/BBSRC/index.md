The objectives of the project 'Addressing malnutrition with biofortified maize in Zimbabwe; from crop management to policy and consumers' are to evaluate the new pro-vitamin A (PVA) lines in Zimbabwe under different agronomic practices to gain knowledge on the combination of bio + agronomic fortification, to determine the actual nutrient content of the new PVA lines in farmers' fields with different fertility status, and to predict the dietary mineral supply at regional level with and without bio + agronomic fortification.
