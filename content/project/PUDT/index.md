The Republic of Congo envisions to diversify its economy by developing environmentally friendly farming, to contribute to food self-sufficiency and to improve the living standards of the population. Fulfilling this objective requires guidance for the spatial allocation of agricultural activities, conservation areas and infrastructures, in order to minimize trade-offs between productivity, economic profitability, biodiversity conservation, and other sectors of activity such as mining, forestry, while acknowledging the economic development goal of Congo, requiring new roads, industries transformation, and social infrastructure. Funded by the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), the ‘Programme d’Utilisation Durable des Terres’ (2022-2026) aims at 1) establishing a land-use plan at national and department levels, 2) sustainably managing forests, 3) delineating the agricultural domains and guiding the implementation of zero-deforestation farming and 4) supplying Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire in sustainable energies.
