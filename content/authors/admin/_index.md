Frédéric Baudron is a Senior Scientist at the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), based in Montpellier, France. Prior to this, he was a Principal Scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), based first in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2011–2016), and later in Harare, Zimbabwe (2016–2023).

Trained as a tropical agronomist in France, he specialized in livestock science and began his career focusing on the interface between people – mainly farmers – and wildlife in Zimbabwe and neighboring countries. He earned his PhD in plant production systems from Wageningen University (The Netherlands) and later obtained his Habilitation to Direct Research from the University of Montpellier (France).

Baudron has been involved in numerous research projects across the Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. He has 24 years of experience developing solutions with and for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.

His research interests include farming systems research, sustainable intensification, the agriculture–biodiversity nexus, appropriate mechanization, participatory innovation development, agronomy-at-scale, and root and tuber crops. He is well published, with 92 peer-reviewed papers, 4412 citations, and an h-index of 36 in the Scopus database (as of 6 November 2025).
