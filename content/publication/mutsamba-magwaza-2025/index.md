abstract: "CONTEXT. in Zimbabwe, farm productivity of smallholder farmers practising mixed crop-livestock farming is hindered by climate variability, inadequate nutritious feeds, poor soil fertility, and resource trade-offs. Despite these challenges, positive deviants (PDs) within these communities achieve better outcomes using resources similar to those of other farmers. OBJECTIVE. This study sought to identify crop-livestock practices that enable PDs to outperform low-efficiency farms (LEFs) and to compare their farm productivity (energy output), nutrient quantities added to croplands, gross margins and return on investment (ROI) from crop production. METHODS. Data from a survey conducted in Mutoko and Buhera districts of Zimbabwe in 2021 were used to derive a farm typology per district and identify PDs and LEFs within farm types. Selected farms were subjected to detailed surveys to identify their specific practices. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. Compared to LEFs, PD farmers achieved significantly greater crop productivity — by 86 %, 89 % and 28 % — and livestock productivity — by 156 %, 101 % and 136 % on better-off, average and poorly-resourced farms, respectively. PDs had larger cropping areas (on average 42 % more) and owned more livestock (39 % more TLUs) than LEFs, but this does not fully explain differences in productivity. PDs used more inputs (fertilizer, labour and others) for crop production than LEFs and added more carbon and nitrogen to their soils. In both districts, PDs consistently outperformed LEFs in gross margins and ROI. The differences in economic performance between PDs and LEFs were more pronounced among the better-off farmers. Key practices contributing to PDs’ success included recommended fertilizer use, timely operations, livestock supplementary feeding, fodder production, and adherence to extension advice. Financial shortages for the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, and veterinary drugs and poor access to information are potential hindrances to the adoption of PD practices by LEF farmers. SIGNIFICANCE. The combination of a farm typology and the PD approach helped to tailor recommendations to farms differing in resource-endowment, based on successful practices implemented in the region."
